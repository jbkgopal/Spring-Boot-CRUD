SpringBoot api layers Controller,service and DAO

In a Spring Boot application, it's common to organize your code into different layers to achieve separation of concerns and maintain a clean and modular architecture. The three main layers you mentioned are:

Controller Layer:

This layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
Controllers receive input from the client, process it (usually by invoking service methods), and return the result.
Annotate your controller classes or methods with @RestController or @Controller to indicate that they handle HTTP requests.
Example Controller:

@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @GetMapping("api/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> showSingleStudentRecord(@PathVariable int id) {
        String result = myService.showSingleStudentRecord(id);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(result, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}

Service Layer:

This layer contains the business logic of your application. It is responsible for processing data, applying business rules, and interacting with the data access layer (DAO) to perform CRUD operations.
Annotate your service classes with @Service to indicate that they hold the business logic.
Example Service:

@Service
public class MyService {

	@Autowired
	private MyDAO myDAO;

	public String showSingleStudentRecord(int id) {
		return myDAO.showSingleStudentRecord(id);
	}
}




DAO (Data Access Object) Layer:

This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data storage. It abstracts the data access and provides a clean interface for the service layer to interact with the data.
Annotate your DAO classes with @Repository.
Example DAO:


@Repository
public class MyDAO {

	@Autowired
	SessionFactory sf;
	
	public String showSingleStudentRecord(int id) {
		// Database interaction code
		Session s=sf.openSession();
		Student ss=s.get(Student.class, id);
		return "Show Single Student Record \n"+ss;
	}
}



Remember to configure your Spring Boot application properly with annotations like @SpringBootApplication on your main class or with XML configuration, depending on your preference. Additionally, make sure to use @Autowired or constructor injection to inject dependencies between these layers. This way, each layer is loosely coupled and can be tested independently.
